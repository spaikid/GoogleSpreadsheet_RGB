# GoogleSpreadsheet_RGB
Create background cell from 3 rgb input

Script for AEC industry.
To solve a problem during a routine task, I deploy this simple Google Apps Scripts to read the value from three cells and change the background colors of the selected cell.
Not so difficult, but it can solve some problems where you have to manage and analyze how many colors you have in a facade, how many tiles of that color, and how many sqm of that particular tiles.
That is aid with the possibility to visualize the color directly and change on the fly after a client changes mind.
